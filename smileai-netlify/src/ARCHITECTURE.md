## ❓ FAQ

### Q: How do I access the CRM dashboard?
**A:** Click the floating button in the bottom-right corner that says "🌐 Public Landing Page" or "🏥 CRM Internal App" and click "Open CRM Internal Dashboard"

### Q: Why don't I see a login screen?
**A:** In development mode, authentication is bypassed for demo purposes. In production, CRM platform handles OAuth automatically when users access the app through the CRM marketplace.

### Q: How do patient submissions reach the CRM dashboard?
**A:** When a patient submits the intake form, a webhook fires to the CRM API creating a new contact with all form data and uploaded media. This contact then appears in the Patients view of the CRM dashboard.

### Q: Can I customize the branding?
**A:** Yes! In the CRM dashboard, go to Settings view to upload your clinic logo and change primary/accent colors. Changes apply instantly. There's also a quick demo panel in the bottom-left corner for testing.

### Q: What happens to uploaded photos?
**A:** Photos are stored in CRM platform's media library and linked to the contact record. Dental staff can view, download, and manage all uploaded media in the Contact Profile's media gallery.

### Q: How does the review status pipeline work?
**A:** Staff can update a patient's status through 5 stages (New Submission → Media Received → Under Review → Dentist Reviewed → Patient Contacted). This is visible in the Contact Profile and can trigger automated workflows in CRM.
