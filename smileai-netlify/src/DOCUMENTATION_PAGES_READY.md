2. **Set up email** - support@smilevisionpro.ai must work
3. **Take screenshots** - 3-5 screenshots for GHL marketplace
4. **Fill in form** - Use `/GHL_FORM_READY_TO_PASTE.txt`
5. **Submit to GHL!** - You're ready!

## ⚠️ If URLs Don't Load

If you get 404 errors, you may need to configure your hosting:

**For Vercel:**
Add to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

**For Netlify:**
Add to `netlify.toml`:
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

But this should work automatically since you're using React Router-style routing!

## ✅ READY TO SUBMIT!

All documentation pages are integrated into your app.
Staff login works.
Everything is ready for GHL marketplace submission!

Copy the text from: `/GHL_FORM_READY_TO_PASTE.txt`
And paste it into the GHL marketplace form!

Good luck! 🎉
