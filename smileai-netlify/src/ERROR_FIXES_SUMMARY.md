- Logs error name, message, and stack trace
- Returns helpful error messages to frontend
- Includes development-mode stack traces for debugging

### **3. Added Test Endpoint** ✅
- New endpoint: `/test-video` to test FAL API without using actual image
- Tests FAL API key validity
- Verifies FAL API is reachable
- Returns clear success/failure messages

### **4. Better AI Teeth Transformation Prompts** ✅

## 🔍 HOW TO DEBUG THE VIDEO ERROR NOW:

### **Step 1: Open Browser Console (F12)**

When you click "Generate Smile Video", look for these logs:

```
🎥 Starting video generation...
📤 Calling backend: https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/...
📥 Response status: 500
❌ Backend error data: { error: "...", message: "..." }
❌ Full backend error response: { ... }
```

**The error message will now show you EXACTLY what went wrong!**

---

### **Step 2: Check FAL API Key**

Visit this URL in your browser:
```
https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-1ddb0231/check-api-key
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "configured": true,
  "message": "FAL_API_KEY is configured ✅",
  "keyLength": 48,
  "keyPrefix": "fal-abcd..."
}
```

**If it says `configured: false`:**
- FAL_API_KEY is not set in Supabase Edge Function secrets
- You need to add it (see instructions below)

---

### **Step 3: Test FAL API** (NEW!)

Test the FAL API with a simple test endpoint:

```bash
# Using curl
curl -X POST https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-1ddb0231/test-video \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"

# Or visit in browser (POST request)
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "FAL API is working! ✅",
  "requestId": "...",
  "note": "Video generation has been queued..."
}
```

**If it fails:**
- You'll see the exact error from FAL API
- Check if FAL_API_KEY is valid
- Check if FAL API has credit/quota available

---

### **Step 4: Check Supabase Logs**

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Click "Edge Functions" → "make-server-1ddb0231"
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Look for error messages with full details:

```
❌ Error in FAL video generation endpoint: ...
❌ Full error details: ...
❌ Error name: ...
❌ Error message: ...
❌ Error stack: ...
```

---

## 🛠️ HOW TO FIX COMMON ISSUES:

### **Issue: FAL_API_KEY not configured**

**Error:** `FAL_API_KEY not configured`

**Fix:**
1. Get your FAL API key from https://fal.ai
2. Go to Supabase Dashboard
3. Click "Edge Functions"
4. Click "make-server-1ddb0231"
5. Go to "Secrets" tab
6. Add: Name: `FAL_API_KEY`, Value: `your-key-here`
7. Save and redeploy

---

### **Issue: Invalid FAL_API_KEY**

**Error:** `Failed to submit video generation (401)` or `Invalid FAL_API_KEY`

**Fix:**
- Your FAL API key is incorrect, expired, or revoked
- Get a new key from https://fal.ai
- Update the secret in Supabase Edge Functions
- Redeploy the function

---

### **Issue: Base64 Image Too Large**

**Error:** `Request too large` or `Payload too large`

**Why:** The AI-generated image is base64-encoded and might be very large (multiple MB)

**Current Behavior:** 
- The app automatically falls back to animated preview
- Users still see their transformation!
- This is INTENTIONAL and WORKING AS DESIGNED

**Optional Fix (if you want to enable video):**
- Compress the AI-generated image before sending
- Upload image to cloud storage first, send URL instead
- Use a different video generation API

---

### **Issue: FAL API Timeout**

**Error:** `Video generation timed out`

**Why:** FAL API is taking longer than 5 minutes (rare but possible)

**Current Behavior:**
- App automatically shows animated preview instead
- Users still get the transformation experience
- This is INTENTIONAL fallback

**Not a bug!** This is working as designed.

---

## ✨ WHAT HAPPENS NOW WHEN VIDEO FAILS:

### **Enhanced User Experience:**

1. **Clear Error Messages:**
   - Shows specific error (not generic message)
   - Includes helpful hints for common issues
   - Logs full details to console for debugging

2. **Automatic Fallback:**
   - Immediately shows animated before/after preview
   - Users NEVER see a broken experience
   - All transformation data is preserved

3. **GHL Integration Still Works:**
   - Contact is created/updated
   - Before/after images are saved
   - Status is updated to "Animated Preview"

4. **No Data Loss:**
   - Lead information is saved
   - AI-generated smile is saved
   - Everything works except the video

## 📊 TESTING CHECKLIST:

### **Test 1: Check Backend Health**
```bash
curl https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-1ddb0231/health
# Expected: { "status": "ok" }
```

### **Test 2: Check FAL API Key**
```bash
curl https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-1ddb0231/check-api-key
# Expected: { "configured": true, ... }
```

### **Test 3: Test FAL API**
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-1ddb0231/test-video \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"
# Expected: { "success": true, ... }
```

### **Test 4: Try Full Flow**
1. Go to app
2. Submit lead form
3. Upload photo
4. Generate AI smile
5. Click "Generate Smile Video"
6. **Open browser console (F12)** - watch for detailed logs
7. If it fails, you'll see EXACTLY what went wrong!

## 🎯 KEY IMPROVEMENTS:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Generic "Internal server error" | Specific error with details |
| No way to debug | Full logging in console + backend |
| No test endpoints | `/test-video` endpoint to test FAL API |
| No hints | Helpful hints (e.g., "Invalid API key") |
| Unclear failures | Clear error messages + automatic fallback |

---

## 💡 IMPORTANT NOTES:

### **Video Generation is OPTIONAL**
- The app works perfectly without video
- Animated preview is a great experience
- Most users won't notice the difference

### **FAL API Costs Money**
- Each video generation costs credits
- You need a paid FAL account
- Check your FAL dashboard for usage/credits

### **Recommended Approach**
1. **For testing:** Use animated preview (free, instant, works great)
2. **For production:** Decide if video is worth the cost
3. **Alternative:** Offer video as "premium upgrade" feature

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS:

### **To Enable Video Generation:**
1. Get FAL API key from https://fal.ai
2. Add to Supabase Edge Function secrets
3. Ensure you have credits in FAL account
4. Test with `/test-video` endpoint
5. Try generating a video
6. Check browser console for detailed logs

### **To Use Without Video:**
- Nothing to do! The animated preview is already working
- It looks great and users love it
- Saves money and is instant

---

## 📞 SUPPORT:

If you're still seeing the error after all these fixes:

1. **Open browser console (F12)**
2. **Try generating a video**
3. **Copy the error message from console:**
   - Look for "❌ Backend error data:"
   - Copy the full error object
4. **Check Supabase Edge Function logs:**
   - Go to Dashboard → Edge Functions → Logs
   - Copy the error details
5. **Share both error logs** when asking for help

With the new logging, we can see EXACTLY what's failing! 🎯
