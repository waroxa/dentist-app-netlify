## 🖼️ Media Files Uploaded

When a transformation is completed, these files are attached to the contact:

1. **before-smile.jpg** - Original uploaded photo
2. **after-smile-ai.jpg** - AI-enhanced smile image
3. **smile-video.mp4** - Generated smile animation (if available)

Files are currently attached as **notes** with file references. For direct file uploads, additional API implementation is needed.

## 🚨 Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue: Custom fields not populating
**Fix**: Make sure the custom field API keys match exactly (case-sensitive):
- `service_interest` (not `serviceInterest`)
- `transformation_status` (not `transformationStatus`)
- `lead_source` (not `leadSource`)

### Issue: Tags not applying
**Fix**: Verify your API key has `tags.write` permission enabled

### Issue: Phone formatting error
**Fix**: App auto-formats to E.164 format. GHL expects country code (+1 for US).
Current format: `(555) 123-4567` → Converted to: `+15551234567`

### Issue: Images not uploading
**Fix**: 
- Current version adds notes with file references
- For direct uploads: Implement multipart/form-data to GHL's file storage endpoint
- Alternative: Use Cloudinary/AWS S3 and store URLs in custom fields

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Create a test location** in GHL to avoid polluting production data
2. **Use different phone formats** to test validation (international, different countries)
3. **Set up a test pipeline** to visualize the lead flow
4. **Create saved filters** for:
   - All AI leads (tag: `ai-lead`)
   - Pending transformations (status: `Pending`)
   - Ready for follow-up (status: `Complete` + no consultation booked)

4. **Monitor API usage** in GHL settings to ensure you're within rate limits
