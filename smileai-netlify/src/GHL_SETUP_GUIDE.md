## 🎥 How Video Saving Works

When a customer generates a smile video:

1. **Video is generated** using FAL AI (Kling Video API)
2. **Video URL is returned** from the API
3. **Contact is updated** in GHL with:
   - `smile_video_url` custom field = video URL
   - A note is added with clickable video link
   - Status updated to "Complete - Video Generated"

### Accessing the Video in GHL

**Option 1: Custom Field**
- Open contact → Custom Fields → `smile_video_url`
- Click the URL to watch the video

**Option 2: Notes**
- Open contact → Notes tab
- Look for "🎥 AI Smile Video Generated!"
- Click the video link

## 🏷️ Tags & Automation

### Auto-Applied Tags

Every lead gets tagged with:
- `smile-transformation`
- `ai-lead`

### Recommended Workflows

Create GHL workflows triggered by these tags:

**Workflow 1: New Lead Welcome**
- Trigger: Tag added `smile-transformation`
- Action: Send welcome email with video preview
- Action: SMS with consultation booking link

**Workflow 2: Video Generated**
- Trigger: Custom field `transformation_status` = "Complete - Video Generated"
- Action: Send email: "Your Smile Video is Ready!"
